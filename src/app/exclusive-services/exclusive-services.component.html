        <p  class="text-justify">Generally, a Joint Venture (JV) is a way to enter the Indian market in sectors where in there is a legal requirement for a local partner or there is a % cap on foreign investments. But a foreign company with eligibility for a 100% subsidiary can also go through a Joint Venture (JV). A foreign company can set up its operations in India in any sector, except for a 100% ban on foreign investment such as defense, agriculture etc., by a strategic alliance with an Indian partner company. Like all the other companies, the Joint ventures are also formed under the Companies Act, 1956. A Joint Venture can exist in with a present Indian company or a new entity with an Indian partner(s). In any of the circumstances, the Indian company, existing or new, has to come forth the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and the Reserve Bank of India, with the foreign partner company with a request intended for approving the planned foreign investment in the specific business and sector.</p>
